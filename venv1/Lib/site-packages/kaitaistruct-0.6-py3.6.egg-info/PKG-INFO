Description: # Kaitai Struct: runtime library for Python
        
        This library implements Kaitai Struct API for Python.
        
        [Kaitai Struct](http://kaitai.io) is a declarative language used for
        describe various binary data structures, laid out in files or in memory:
        i.e. binary file formats, network stream packet formats, etc.
        
        It is similar to Python's [construct] and [Construct3], but it is
        language-agnostic. The format description is done in YAML-based .ksy
        format, which then can be compiled into a wide range of target languages.

        `requirements.txt` to manage your dependencies, just add the following
        line to it:
        
        ```
        kaitaistruct
        ```
        
        and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to update all your
        dependencies.
        
        ### Using `pip` directly
        
        You can use
        
        ```shell
