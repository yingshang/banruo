        0.13.7 (2016-12-27):
          - fix for issue 85, constructor.py importing unicode_literals caused mypy to fail

          - fix for issue 84, deepcopy not properly working (reported by Peter Amstutz)
        
        0.13.4 (2016-12-05):
          - another fix for issue 82, change to non-global resolver data broke implicit type
            specification
        
        0.13.3 (2016-12-05):

        0.13.1 (2016-11-22):
          - optimisations on memory usage when loading YAML from large files (py3: -50%, py2: -85%)
        
        0.13.0 (2016-11-20):
          - if ``load()`` or ``load_all()`` is called with only a single argument
            (stream or string)
            a UnsafeLoaderWarning will be issued once. If appropriate you can surpress this
            warning by filtering it. Explicitly supplying the ``Loader=ruamel.yaml.Loader``
            argument, will also prevent it from being issued. You should however consider
            using ``safe_load()``, ``safe_load_all()`` if your YAML input does not use tags.
          - allow adding comments before and after keys (based on
            `StackOveflow Q&A <http://stackoverflow.com/a/40705671/1307905>`_  by
            `msinn <http://stackoverflow.com/users/7185467/msinn>`_)

        0.12.17 (2016-11-15):
          - only the RoundTripLoader included the Resolver that supports YAML 1.2
            now all loaders do (reported by mixmastamyk)
        
        0.12.16 (2016-11-13):
          - allow dot char (and many others) in anchor name
            Fix issue 72 (reported by Shalon Wood)
          - Slightly smarter behaviour dumping strings when no style is
            specified. Single string scalars that start with single quotes
            or have newlines now are dumped double quoted: "'abc\nklm'" instead of::
        
              '''abc
        
                klm'''
        
        0.12.14 (2016-09-21):
         - preserve round-trip sequences that are mapping keys
           (prompted by stackoverflow question 39595807 from Nowox)
        
        0.12.13 (2016-09-15):
         - Fix for issue #60 representation of CommentedMap with merge
           keys incorrect (reported by Tal Liron)
        
        0.12.11 (2016-09-06):
         - Fix issue 58 endless loop in scanning tokens (reported by
           Christopher Lambert)
        
        0.12.10 (2016-09-05):
         - Make previous fix depend on unicode char width (32 bit unicode support
           is a problem on MacOS reported by David Tagatac)
        
        0.12.8 (2016-09-05):
           - To be ignored Unicode characters were not properly regex matched
             (no specific tests, PR by Haraguroicha Hsu)
        
        0.12.7 (2016-09-03):
           - fixing issue 54 empty lines with spaces (reported by Alex Harvey)
        
        0.12.6 (2016-09-03):
           - fixing issue 46 empty lines between top-level keys were gobbled (but
             not between sequence elements, nor between keys in netsted mappings
             (reported by Alex Harvey)
        
        0.12.5 (2016-08-20):
          - fixing issue 45 preserving datetime formatting (submitted by altuin)
            Several formatting parameters are preserved with some normalisation:
          - preserve 'T', 't' is replaced by 'T', multiple spaces between date
            and time reduced to one.
          - optional space before timezone is removed
          - still using microseconds, but now rounded (.1234567 -> .123457)
          - Z/-5/+01:00 preserved
        
        0.12.4 (2016-08-19):
          - Fix for issue 44: missing preserve_quotes keyword argument (reported
            by M. Crusoe)
        
        0.12.3 (2016-08-17):
          - correct 'in' operation for merged CommentedMaps in round-trip mode
            (implementation inspired by J.Ngo, but original not working for merges)
          - iteration over round-trip loaded mappings, that contain merges. Also
            keys(), items(), values() (Py3/Py2) and iterkeys(), iteritems(),
            itervalues(), viewkeys(), viewitems(), viewvalues() (Py2)
          - reuse of anchor name now generates warning, not an error. Round-tripping such
            anchors works correctly. This inherited PyYAML issue was brought to attention
            by G. Coddut (and was long standing https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=515634)
            suppressing the warning::
        
                import warnings
                from ruamel.yaml.error import ReusedAnchorWarning
                warnings.simplefilter("ignore", ReusedAnchorWarning)
        
        0.12.2 (2016-08-16):
          - minor improvements based on feedback from M. Crusoe
            https://bitbucket.org/ruamel/yaml/issues/42/
        
        0.12.0 (2016-08-16):
          - drop support for Python 2.6
          - include initial Type information (inspired by M. Crusoe)
        
        0.11.15 (2016-08-07):
          - Change to prevent FutureWarning in NumPy, as reported by tgehring
            ("comparison to None will result in an elementwise object comparison in the future")
        
        0.11.14 (2016-07-06):
          - fix preserve_quotes missing on original Loaders (as reported
            by Leynos, bitbucket issue 38)
        
        0.11.13 (2016-07-06):
          - documentation only, automated linux wheels
        
        0.11.12 (2016-07-06):
          - added support for roundtrip of single/double quoted scalars using:
            ruamel.yaml.round_trip_load(stream, preserve_quotes=True)
        
        0.11.0 (2016-02-18):
          - RoundTripLoader loads 1.2 by default (no sexagesimals, 012 octals nor
            yes/no/on/off booleans
